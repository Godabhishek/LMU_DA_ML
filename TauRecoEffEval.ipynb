    "### Predicting reconstruction efficiencies for tau leptons\n",
    "This is a physics-inspired challenge where your task is to make the best possible predictions for the probability that a certain particle, a tau lepton, will be correctly reconstructed in the detector. We simulated a lot (hundred of thousands) of collisions of a proton with another proton, where in each of these events, a small number of tau leptons (1, 2, or 3) is produced. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to detect (\"reconstruct\") the presence of a tau lepton in a particle detector, as they decay before they have a chance to interact with the detector. We thus only see the decay products of the tau leptons, and from this only slightly more than half of the tau leptons is actually reconstructed as a tau lepton.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that a given true tau lepton is reconstructed (\"reconstruction efficiency\") depends on its properties: how much energy is has and where it hits our detector. The goal in this challenge is to predict this probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a nice opportunity to practice our newly learned skills in data analysis and machine learning! Let's get to work..."
